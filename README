recads - restricted environment c algrithms and data structures

This projects is created to provide some classic data structure and related algrithms for some resource restricted environment, such as old OS, or embedded environment.I'll restricted the C Library usage, such as qsort functions WON'T be used in this project.

As this project is design for restricted enviroment, I'll use the stupid and sample GNU make as our build system, so we'll reduce the tools usage.

These source code are distributed under the liscense of BSD, so you can do whatever you want only keep the original author information.

I'll add more discription after I actually wrote some code.


Love,
Leaf(In the memory of Ken)
